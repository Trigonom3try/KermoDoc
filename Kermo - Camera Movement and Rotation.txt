CAMERA MOVEMENT AND ROTATION

-when the camera gets initialized, the origin gets set to the midpoint of the 
	worldsize along each axis (~500000 ?),
	and the normals get inited as follows:

	-Xnormal = new Vector(1, AXIS.Xpos);
	-Ynormal = new Vector(1, AXIS.Ypos);
	-Znormal = new Vector(1, AXIS.Zpos);
	
--> remember that whenever the camera is rotated, it is always rotated about it's own
	basis, and not around the axes :

Rotate Up / Down : the Znormal and Ynormal rotate around the Xnormal

Left / Right : the Znormal and Xnormal rotate around the Ynormal

Clockwise / Counter-clockwise : the Xnormal and Ynormal rotate around the Znormal


-moving the camera forward is of course equivalent to adding the components of its
	Znormal (converted to ints) to its origin coordinates
-moving it backward is equivalent to subtracting the same
-moving it sideways is equivalent to adding/subtracting the components of its Xnormal
-moving it up/down is adding/subtracting the components of its Ynormal
